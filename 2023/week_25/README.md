# UFO Sightings Redux

The data this week comes from the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/webreports/ndxshape.html), [cleaned](https://github.com/jonthegeek/apis/blob/main/01_ufo-data.qmd) and [enriched](https://github.com/jonthegeek/apis/blob/main/01_ufo-enrich.qmd) with data from [sunrise-sunset.org](https://sunrise-sunset.org/) by [Jon Harmon](https://github.com/jonthegeek/apis/).

If this dataset looks familiar, that's because we [used a version of it back in 2019](https://tidytues.day/2019/2019-06-25). The new version adds the last several years of data, adds information about time-of-day, and cleans up some errors in the original dataset. We'd love to see visualizations describing the differences between the 2019 dataset and this new dataset!

> The [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/) was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator [Robert J. Gribble](https://nuforc.org/gribble/). The Centerâ€™s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events.  Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 170,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.
