This repository contains my submissions for the weekly data visualization challenge [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

TidyTuesday is a weekly data analysis and visualization challenge that provides a structured format to practice data wrangling and visualization skills using R programming language. Each week, a new dataset is posted to the [TidyTuesday Github repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) and participants are encouraged to explore and visualize the data using the principles of tidy data.
